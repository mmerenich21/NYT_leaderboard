I created this project on a whim when my friends started a friendly competition in the New York Times Mini Crossword.
I became curious if I could somehow get this data and summarize it to create stats: who is the best player over the last month?

This code will scrape my personal leaderboard each day, clean and format the data into a dictionary, and export to a CSV.
I plan on creating metrics and stats on average times by player, determining which day is typically the most difficult puzzles, and other neat insights.

What started as a game amongst friends is now a (mini) data science project!
